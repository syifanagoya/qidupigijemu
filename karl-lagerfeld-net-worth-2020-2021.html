He got a chance to work under Pierre Balmain, after this win. He held this position for three years. For the next few years, he designed haute couture collections at a tremendous rate. The first of his collections, with all its path-breaking and unconventional cuts, was not widely accepted by the critics and fashion enthusiasts. An Italian brand Tiziani, which specializes in couture, was his next place of employment.</p><p>He was reportedly a part of the company’s team of designers till 1966. This particular line of clothing had some high profile customers, including Elizabeth Taylor and Gina Lollobrigida, to name a few. In the meantime, he started designing as a freelancer at Chloe, which is a fashion brand based in France.</p><p>In this period, he had also done some designs for a brand called Curiel, most of which were appreciated for their out of the box concepts. In 1973, he did the spring collection for Chloe. One of the most unique and eye-catching garments in this line was something he had named a surprise skirt. By this time, he had already started working with the Italian brand Fendi.</p><p>However, his shot to international fame has definitely been through his career at Channel. In fact, he is credited for conceptualizing the interlocked C’s monograph of Coco Channel as the symbol for the brand. Later, Lagerfeld went on to run different brands and clothing lines, including his namesake – the Lagerfeld Gallery.</p><p>The big names he has been known to be involved in the later years are Diesel, H&M, etc. He had even been involved with several movie projects. His directorial work is “Once Upon a Time,” which featured Keira Knightley as Coco Channel.</p><h2>Awards and Achievements</h2><p>He has the world reputation as a star creative director. He owns several stores and clothing lines and is also known for achieving an amazing weight loss goal, which has resulted in a book, “The diet of Karl Lagerfeld.”</p><h2>Net Worth & Salary of Karl Lagerfeld in 2024</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Karl-Lagerfeld-Net-Worth.jpg><p>As of July 2024, Karl Lagerfeld’s Net-worth is estimated to be $230 million, which includes his several assets and astounding earnings as a star designer.</p><p>Karl Lagerfeld has seen his fair share of controversies throughout his life, including about with PETA.

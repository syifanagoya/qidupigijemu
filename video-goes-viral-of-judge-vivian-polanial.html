Her Instagram account, which currently boasts over 283k followers, has gained sponsorships from American companies due to her posts featuring their products. This level of social media presence has further contributed to the scrutiny and judgment directed towards her.</p><p>Despite facing backlash for her lifestyle choices, it is important to separate personal conduct from professional ethics when evaluating Judge Polanía’s performance as a judge.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Threats_and_Mental_Health_Struggles></span>Threats and Mental Health Struggles<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Vivian Polanía, the judge who became viral for smoking semi-nude during a virtual hearing, has faced numerous personal challenges throughout her career.

However, these actions have stirred controversy within the legal community.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Investigations_into_Misconduct></span>Investigations into Misconduct<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Polanía’s conduct during virtual hearings has also come under scrutiny by judicial authorities. Following a video that circulated on WhatsApp showing her conducting a court proceeding while lying semi-nude in bed and smoking a cigarette, the National Commission of Judicial Discipline requested an investigation into whether she had committed disciplinary violations. In September 2020, the Disciplinary Chamber of the Superior Council of Judicature in North Santander initiated an investigation into Polanía after media headlines labeled her as “the sexiest judge.” The Council subsequently issued a circular reminding all judicial officials to maintain a proper appearance befitting their high role. In February 2021, the Cúcuta District Judicial Tribunal issued another circular recommending that judges keep their cameras on during all legal proceedings, a measure that Polanía allegedly failed to adhere to.</p><p>Despite the controversies surrounding her conduct, Judge Vivian Polanía has chosen not to publicly address the incidents that have garnered attention. An additional video has since gone viral, capturing an instance where she jokingly recommended a prosecutor to take “a few drops of marijuana,” quickly correcting herself and referring to “drops of valerian.” These events have further fueled discussions about her suitability as a public servant.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Judge_Vivian_Polanias_personal_circumstances_including_mental_health_struggles_and_threats_received></span>Judge Vivian Polanía’s personal circumstances, including mental health struggles and threats received<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><img decoding=async title="Judge Vivian Polanía" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ndtmusic.edu.vn/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/video_goes_viral_on_instagram_of_judge_vivian_polanial-2.jpeg alt="Judge Vivian Polanía" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Judge Vivian Polanía’s personal circumstances have been the subject of much attention and controversy. Apart from her recent viral video where she appeared semi-nude and smoking during a virtual hearing, there are other aspects of her life that have contributed to discussions about her role as a public servant.</p><p>Firstly, Judge Polanía has faced mental health struggles. According to sources close to her, she has been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. These conditions have reportedly affected her ability to perform her duties at times and have led to extended periods of time spent at home under the protection of security escorts. It is believed that these mental health issues are connected to the immense pressure and stress associated with her position as a judge in Cúcuta, particularly given the threats she has received.</p><p>Indeed, another significant aspect of Judge Polanía’s personal circumstances is the threats she has received from criminal groups operating along the border with Venezuela. For the past three years, she has lived with constant fear for her safety due to these threats. This has resulted in heightened security measures being implemented, including having security escorts accompany her wherever she goes. The nature of these threats is unknown, but they are serious enough for Judge Polanía to require ongoing protection.</p><h3>Reactions from within the judicial community<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The controversial actions and personal circumstances of Judge Vivian Polanía have not gone unnoticed by her colleagues in the judicial community. Many have expressed discomfort and disapproval regarding her attire choices and “fitness” lifestyle on social media. Her frequent posting of provocative images in revealing clothing, showcasing her numerous tattoos and exercise routines have generated criticism among fellow judges. This has created tension within their professional relationships.</p><p>In September 2020, following the media frenzy surrounding Judge Polanía being labeled as “the sexiest judge,” the Disciplinary Chamber of the Superior Council of the Judiciary in Norte de Santander opened an investigation into her conduct. This led to a circular being issued by the local judiciary council reminding all court officials to maintain appropriate personal presentation that aligns with the decorum expected of their esteemed positions. Despite these measures, subsequent incidents, including the recent virtual hearing, have brought further attention and scrutiny to Judge Polanía’s actions.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Social_media_presence_and_legal_implications></span>Social media presence and legal implications<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>One aspect that has added fuel to the controversy surrounding Judge Vivian Polanía is her active social media presence. She boasts a substantial following on Instagram, with over 283,000 followers across two accounts (due to her original account being blocked). Her popularity on the platform has attracted sponsorship from North American companies. However, it has also raised questions about potential conflicts of interest and ethical concerns regarding how she presents herself as a public servant.</p><p>The video circulating on WhatsApp showing Judge Polanía conducting a judicial proceeding semi-nude and smoking in bed has prompted inquiries into whether she committed any disciplinary offenses. The National Commission for Judicial Discipline has requested an investigation into her alleged misconduct during this virtual hearing. Additionally, in February 2021, the Cúcuta Judicial District Superior Court issued a circular recommending that judges keep their cameras turned on during all court proceedings – a guideline that appears not to have been followed by Judge Polanía.</p><p>While Judge Polanía has remained silent regarding the recent virtual hearing incident, she posted a cryptic message on her Instagram account stating “Only God knows the cross you bear.” It is clear that her personal circumstances, including mental health struggles and threats received, have had significant impacts on both her professional and personal life. The ongoing investigations and debates surrounding her conduct contribute to a complex narrative surrounding this controversial judge.</p><p>The viral video featuring Judge Vivian Polanial on Instagram has captured the attention of many. With its widespread reach and high engagement, it highlights the growing influence of social media platforms in disseminating information and impacting public perception. This incident serves as a reminder of the power and potential consequences that come with sharing content online, especially for public figures like Judge Polanial.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.ytimg.com/vi/KW8sRJCD0a0/hqdefault.jpg alt="YouTube video" width=480 height=360 data-pin-nopin=true nopin=nopin style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlKm6tr%2FInGWenKVjw6971aKbnqddnLymv4yvoKuZnGK8p3nJrpugnV2rtre1wKdkqaeclruqrcto</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./billy-gardell-net-worth-income-salary-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Billy Gardell Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">&larr;

It’s a dermatologist-tested formula that will kill bacteria on your skin while treating your breakouts.

The lower strengths can be as effective as the higher strengths, but without the irritation – perfect for those who have more sensitive skin. “The heavy-duty treatments are a higher percent of benzoyl peroxide, and they tend to be more of a leave-on spot treatment,” Dr. Saedi says. The preventative treatments have lower percentages and are used on a daily basis.</li><li><strong>Leave On or Wash Off Formula: </strong>“Benzoyl peroxide can be washed off or remain on the skin as a treatment for excessive oil production, enlarged pores, and breakouts,” says Dr. Sobel. Dr. Saedi says the most common formulas are cleansers. Cleansers work well for those who are breaking out all over their face, and could benefit from a deeper cleanse. Those who experience a blemish here and there may benefit more from a spot treatment and drying lotion.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Your Skin Type</strong>: Something you want to keep in mind before picking up a face wash or spot treatment is your skin type. Are you more on the oily side? Do you often experience breakouts? Does your skin feel dry after you wash it? These are important questions to ask yourself before choosing what BP product you want to use, as well as what percentage you decide to try. Oily skin can benefit from using a product with BP because it works to kill bacteria underneath your skin while getting rid of dead skin cells found in your pores as well as excess sebum – all without stripping your skin of moisture.</li><li><strong>Soothing Ingredients: </strong>Benzoyl peroxide is a strong ingredient, and most products that use it are also formulated with soothing ingredients to help calm the skin and reduce the amount of potential irritation. While it’s an effective treatment for acne, it’s a strong, active ingredient that wouldn’t be very pleasant to use without ingredients that soothe and calm your skin. “Look for formulas that contain humectants, ceramides, and are calming, and non-comedogenic,” Dr. Sobel shares. Products that include niacinamide and hyaluronic acid are also ideal.</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered<br></span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What’s better for acne, benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What’s complicated about acne is there are various types one can experience. This can be <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>cystic acne</a>, whiteheads, blackheads, hormonal acne, etc. You can treat these types of acne in a few different ways, and with a plethora of products. But the two types of products that many use for acne are those that include benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Salicylic acid will unclog your pores and diminish blackheads and whiteheads. It works to break down and remove dead skin cells and oil, and exfoliates your skin. Benzoyl peroxide will be more beneficial to those who are experiencing acne such as hormonal and cystic. It works as an antiseptic and gets rid of bacteria on your skin while creating more oxygen in your pores – which makes it difficult for bacteria to live, further preventing new breakouts.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Does benzoyl peroxide cause bleaching?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In short: yes. But have no fear, the item of most concern for this side effect are your towels or sheets. Benzoyl peroxide works by lingering on the skin to target acne-causing bacteria and that remaining ingredient can do a number on your colored linens. Sticks to white fabrics, or buy a cheap towel and set of sheets that you don't mind staining on the nights you're using a BP cleanser or leave-on treatment.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us<br></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sydney Wingfield is a beauty and wellness freelance writer.

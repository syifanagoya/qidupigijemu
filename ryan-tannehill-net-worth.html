He went on to have a terrific rookie season, during which he set franchise rookie records for passing yards, attempts, and completions. Tannehill also set a franchise record for the longest run by a quarterback in a single play, at 31 yards, and became the fifth quarterback in Dolphins history to surpass 3,000 passing yards in one season. He passed that number again in the 2013 season, although he was also sacked a league-leading 58 times. In 2014, Tannehill passed for 4,045 yards and had a career-high 392 pass completions. The following season, he set the all-time NFL record for consecutive completed passes, with 25.

The Titans went on to the postseason, where they upset the New England Patriots in the wild card round before upsetting the Baltimore Ravens in the divisional round. In the AFC Championship Game, the team fell to the eventual Super Bowl champs the Kansas City Chiefs. After the season, Tannehill was named the NFL Comeback Player of the Year. He had another great season in 2020, passing for 3,819 yards with a career-high 33 touchdowns as the Titans finished atop the AFC South with an 11-5 record.

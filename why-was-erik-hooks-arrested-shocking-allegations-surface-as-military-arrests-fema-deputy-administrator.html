The arrest, which took place on August 19, has sent shockwaves through the nation, leaving many questioning the grave accusations that have led to this unprecedented turn of events.</p><p>The arrest reportedly followed a 34-page indictment that outlined serious charges against Hooks and his superior, FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell. According to this indictment, the two allegedly issued directives to FEMA agents stationed in Maui during a catastrophic wildfire crisis. These orders, as per the indictment, have raised significant concerns about their actions during the disaster.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>United States Marines on Saturday arrested Deputy Administrator of FEMA Erik Hooks on charges of treason, alleging in a 34-page indictment that Hooks and his boss, Deanne Criswell, ordered agents in Maui to deny fire victims food and water, to inhibit civilian relief efforts, toâ€¦ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/pMuzkw63T6</a></p><p>â€” ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸WillðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ (@notBilly) <a href=# rel=noopener>August 23, 2023</a></p><p>The indictment alleges that Hooks and Criswell ordered FEMA agents to withhold essential supplies such as food and water from the victims of the wildfire. Furthermore, they were purportedly instructed to hinder civilian relief efforts, prevent displaced individuals from leaving the fire-ravaged area of Lahaina, and dispose of bodies in a manner that raised suspicions of wrongdoing.</p><p>These allegations came to light through a source in General Eric M. Smithâ€™s office, as reported by Real Raw News. Hooksâ€™ arrest unfolded at his residence in Arlington, Virginia, near FEMAâ€™s headquarters in Washington, D.C.</p><p></p><p>Marines apprehended Hooks while he was asleep and presented him with a military arrest warrant detailing the charges against him. He was subsequently taken into custody for processing and further investigation.</p><p>One central piece of evidence mentioned in the case is a typewritten memo allegedly bearing the signatures of both Hooks and Criswell. This memo reportedly directed FEMA supervisors in Maui to discreetly dispose of deceased individuals, either through incineration or secretive burials. While the memo itself doesnâ€™t explicitly instruct the execution of civilians, disturbingly, Marines on the scene claim to have discovered multiple bodies with gunshot wounds consistent with small arms used by FEMA and the FBI.</p><p></p><p>As the news of Hooksâ€™ arrest spreads, questions and skepticism arise about the authenticity of the claims. Neither FEMA nor the U.S. Marines have officially confirmed these allegations. Moreover, the source of the information, Real Raw News, bears resemblance to the satirical Dunning Kruger Times, known for publishing sensational claims.</p><p>Erik Hooksâ€™ journey has been marked by dedication to public service. Before his role as Deputy Administrator at FEMA, Hooks held various positions within the North Carolina Department of Public Safety, ultimately serving as its secretary. His educational background includes a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science and government, as well as a Master of Liberal Arts from North Carolina State University.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/jobsbots.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2308230232.jpg><p>The arrest of a high-ranking FEMA official on charges of treason has ignited a wave of speculation and interest. The situation remains fluid as officials and the public seek clarity on the shocking allegations that have come to light.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiin5fAo7vTrGWcp51kxKnFjLCYrGWVp7aseceopqSrXZa%2Fs7HSrZydZaOdvKS3yKeeZpmcobKordOipqerXajCs7LAnJxmmaNiuqq4yK2Yq7Fdlr%2BzsdKtqmaelaKubrDEqaytsV2Wsa61zaKqraqRqbyzew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./natasha-bure.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Natasha Bure- Meet Eldest Or Single Daughter Of Candace Cameron Bure, and Valeri Bure">&larr;

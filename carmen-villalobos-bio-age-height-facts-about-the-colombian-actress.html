Colombian actress cum model Carmen Villalobos happens to be one such celebrity, after a successful ten-year relationship with her significant other, actor Sebastian Caicedo, they culminated their relationship in a wedding ceremony on the 19th of April 2019.</p><p>Carmen became popular for her supporting roles in several TV shows including the likes of La Tormenta and Amores de Mercado. Her starring role of Alejandra Paz in Niños ricos, pobres padres took her to another level of fame. The actress’ other popular role was as Catalina Santana in Sin senos no hay paraíso, she has played the lead in telenovelas like Ojo por ojo, Mi corazón insiste en Lola Volcán, El Señor de los Cielos and Made in Cartagena.

In 2009, People en Espanol named her as one of the 50 Most Beautiful People.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=carmen-villalobos-bio-age></span><strong>Carmen Villalobos’ Bio (Age)</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>There is not enough info on her personal details but Carmen’s place of birth is Barranquilla, Colombia and she was born with the full name of Yorley del Carmen Villalobos Barrios on the 13th of July 1983. Her parents have been accurately identified as Betty Barrios (mother) and Pedro Villalobos (father), however, it is not known if she has siblings or is an only child. Nothing is known publicly about her academic qualifications and institutions attended but she has fluency in both Spanish and English.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=height-and-other-facts-about-the-colombian-actress></span> <strong>Height and Other F</strong><strong>acts About The Colombian Actress</strong><br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h4><strong>Height</strong></h4><p>Carmen stands 1.55 m tall and weighs 52kg. For bust, waist, and hip, her measurements are listed as 34-26-34 inches. She is brown-eyed and has dark brown hair.</p><h4><strong>Relationship History</strong></h4><p>Carmen Villalobos wedded on the 19th of April 2019, she exchanged marriage vows with her long-time boyfriend, fellow actor Sebastian Caicedo who is two years older than her.</p><p>It is not in doubt that the duo met on set. It was while filming the telenovela Niños Ricos, Pobres Padres that the coupe started developing feelings for each other, especially with all the romancing that their script demanded on set, they gradually hit it off in reality with one of the most unshakable commitments we have seen in the entertainment world so far.</p><p>Prior to their roles together, both Carmen Villalobos and Sebastian were committed to other people, on her own part, the telenovela star was involved in a 7-year long relationship but the name of her then-boyfriend was never publicized. Sebastian had been committed to another lady (name concealed) for five years prior to their meeting.</p><p>Sebastian was already single by the time they wrapped up the filming of the Telenovela and casually enquired about Carmen’s boyfriend, requesting for her to join him for a movie. And so their relationship took off from there. Though they always find themselves in different cities at different times, Sebastine constantly made out time to visit his lady love once every month.</p><p>Following their ten years of a successful relationship, Carmen Villalobos and her significant other decided to take their relationship to the next level after Sebastine popped the big question through a live call on the set of the reality television show popularly known as Exatlón Estados Unidos.</p><p>The couple officially got engaged in August 2018 and a few months later, by January 2019, Carmen Villalobos uploaded an Instagram post containing some of her dance move in a tale followed by her husband-to-be joining her! The duo has become social media stars as they keep sharing their special moments on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter to the admiration of millions of fans.</p><h4><strong>Away From Acting</strong></h4><p>When Carmen Villalobos is not busy with her acting career, she functions as a fashion designer with her brand new collection known as Simplicity. According to the actress, her designs are “simple, simple, but sensual.”</p><h4><strong>Social Media Profile</strong></h4><p>In addition to her acting profession, the star of Niños ricos, pobres padres is a social media sensation with over 11 million following on Instagram as of June 2019.</p><h4><strong>Rumors</strong></h4><p>Rumor suddenly ran rife that Carmen Villalobos has gone under the knife for a breast implant after a social media comment pointed out her seemingly large breasts in a photo she shared. The actress wasted no time in responding that her breasts only seemed big because of the type of bra she wore and not surgery.</p><h4><strong>Net Worth</strong></h4><p>Her annual income has never been reported but speculations are that the actress is worth around $3 million. Carmen’s wealth has come majorly from acting but her work as a fashion designer will take the credit for a digit or two.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJuRp7qmuoyvoKWkkaG8o7vSZpmip12WtKZ5x56goKCkYrOir9OsZJqan6rBbsDHnmScp5ykuqO1wKdkmpukp7K0v44%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./brittany-murphys-dad-slams-lifetime-biopic-star-amanda-fuller-201439.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brittany Murphy's Dad Slams Lifetime Biopic, Star Amanda Fuller">&larr;

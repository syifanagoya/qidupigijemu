She shares the same parents with her younger sister, Julia Feltz whom she has estranged.</p><p>Feltz grew up in Pine Grove, Totteridge and often refers to Totteridge as “the Beverly Hills of North London”. She is of a middle class Jewish background.</p><p>Feltz attended Haberdashers’ Aske’s School for Girls in Elstree, Hertfordshire, an independent institution. Later, she studied English at Trinity College in Cambridge, where she received a first-class honors diploma.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Vanessa Feltz career</h2><p>Feltz was The Jewish Chronicle’s first female columnist before switching to The Daily Mirror. What Are These Strawberries Doing on My Nipples? was the title of the first novel she ever wrote. They are necessary for the fruit salad.</p><p>On The Big Breakfast, a morning television program on Channel 4, Feltz took Paula Yates’ place as the host of a regular segment where she interviewed celebrities while lying on a bed. She claims that Rolf Harris attacked her when she was interviewing him for the show.</p><p>Feltz was deceived by the parody TV program Brass Eye in 1997. When the defendants recognized her from her TV appearances, she was requested to step aside from her position as a magistrate, which she had held since she was 28 years old.</p><p>She served as the host of Anglia Television’s Vanessa, an ITV daytime conversation show. In 1998, she relocated to the BBC to host a comparable program called The Vanessa Show, reportedly for an estimated £2.7 million. Trisha took her spot on ITV.</p><p>Since several of the guests on The Vanessa Show were allegedly actors in 1999, the show received negative press. Feltz was blamed even though she had no part in the guest booking, which led to the show’s cancellation shortly after.</p><p>The mid-afternoon phone-in show that Feltz started hosting for the neighborhood radio station BBC London 94.9 in 2001 has run continuously since then at varied times, from 2005 to 2015 from 09:00 to 12:00. Beginning in 2016, it was broadcast every day from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. On August 26, 2022, she hosted the station’s final program.</p><p>She appeared in a cameo in the comedy Once Upon a Time in the Midlands in 2002. She was ranked 93rd out of the worst 100 Britons in a poll conducted by Channel 4 in May 2003.</p><p>As a spokesman for the fictitious dieting club Fat Fighters, she made a cameo in a segment in the opening episode of the second season of the BBC comic sketch show Little Britain in 2004.</p><p>In 2010, Feltz and Ofoedu won their episode of the Virgin 1 competition A Restaurant in our Living Room in which they hosted a 25-person dinner party at their residence. On September 3, 2010, Feltz returned to the Big Brother house during the final Channel 4 season of Big Brother, Ultimate Big Brother. On September 8, two days before the final, she was kicked out of the house.</p><p>In 2011, Feltz increased his radio and television presenting duties. On January 17, 2011, she took over Sarah Kennedy’s time slot on the BBC Radio 2 Early Breakfast Show, which she broadcasted from 5:00 till 6:00 every weekday.</p><p>Her show was extended by an hour starting in January 2021 and started at a later time of 4:00. When Jeremy Vine wasn’t present, she frequently filled in for him on Radio 2’s news and current affairs program.</p><p>During this period, a different presenter, typically Nicki Chapman took over her early morning breakfast show. On July 28, 2022, Feltz made the announcement that she would quit the program the following day and Radio 2 on August 26, 2022, after filling in for Jeremy Vine for two weeks.</p><p>Following poor ratings for the morning time slot, Channel 5 relocated The Vanessa Show to an afternoon schedule at 14:15 on March 7, 2011. The decision permitted Feltz to continue her live TV show appearances after her morning radio commitments.</p><p>She returned to the Celebrity Big Brother house on September 7, 2013, to participate in a challenge. The very next day, she departed the house. With a salary of £355,000, Feltz was one of three women, together with Claudia Winkleman and Zoe Ball, who were among the ten highest-paid BBC presenters, according to the BBC Annual Report published in July 2019.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is Vanessa Feltz married?</h2><p>Feltz was married to a surgeon who goes by the name of Michael Kurer in 1983. However, they got divorced in 2000.</p><p>Feltz and musician Ben Ofoedu got engaged in December 2006. Originally, they had planned to wed the next year, but they remained together for many years without&nbsp;being married. In February 2023, Feltz revealed that she and Ofoedu had recently broken up.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jq%2BYp52jqK5ussSlq7NlmKrAo63NnWSiq12rrq%2Bx0qyYZp6VocG7ecyaqauhlZl8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./daily-horoscope-12-december-2023.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Daily Horoscope: Tuesday, December 12, 2023">&larr;
